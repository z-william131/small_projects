# small_projects

Here are some of the small projects that I am working on in recent years.

## multi-pad decryption

I built this project when I studied computer security in 2017. 
I learned about the One Time Pad (OTP) and Stream Ciphers, a practical form of using OTPs for encryption.
As the name suggests, a one time pad should only ever be used once when encrypting messages.
For this project, I try to explore what will go wrong if the same keystream (pad) is used multiple times to encrypt messages.
